# drag-and-drop-file-drop-file-
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly drag and drop file upload feature, allowing users to easily upload files to a web application or server by dragging them from their local system and dropping them into a designated area on a web page.

Key Features:

Drag-and-Drop Interface: Users can drag files from their local device and drop them onto a specified area in the application for uploading.
File Preview: Display a preview of the file being uploaded, such as a thumbnail for images or a file name for other types of files.
Multiple File Support: Enable users to upload multiple files simultaneously by dragging and dropping them at once.
File Type Validation: Ensure that only allowed file types (such as images, PDFs, or documents) are uploaded, with error messages for unsupported file formats.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
